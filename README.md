## CodeWars Katas

> One technique I use frequently is the repetition of simple exercises. I call these exercises **kata**. 
A kata usually comes in the form of a **simple programming problem to solve**, such as writing the function that calculates the prime factors of an integer. The point of
doing the kata is not to figure out how to solve the problem. **The point of the kata is to train your fingers and your brain**.

I took these words from "Clean Coder" seriously. 

This repository is updated every day with my solutions of small programming problems from [codewars](https://www.codewars.com).
